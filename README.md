HTML Minifier & QR Tool 🚀
Yo, welcome to the HTML Minifier & QR Tool! This awesome little web tool will let you:

Minify your HTML code (yep, shrink it down to its smallest form!).
Convert that HTML into a Data URL (so you can embed it into links or anything).
Generate a QR Code from that Data URL (just scan it with your phone and bam, you've got your code).
And guess what? You can download that QR code as an image too! 💥

Features:
HTML Minifier: Paste your HTML in, and we'll shrink it like your phone storage when you clear out those old apps. 🚀
Data URL Converter: Turn that minified HTML into a Data URL for easy use in links or embeds. 👾
QR Code Generator: You like QR codes? We got 'em! Generate a QR code from your Data URL in a snap. 📱
Download QR Code: Once your QR code is ready, hit the download button and save it to your computer like a boss. 💾
Clear All: Start fresh with a click. Because sometimes, we all need to hit reset. 🔄
How To Use:
Minify HTML:

Paste your messy HTML into the text box, hit Minify HTML, and boom, it'll turn into a sleek, slimmed-down version.
Convert to Data URL:

Once your HTML is minified, click Convert to Data URL. This will give you a URL representation of your HTML that you can use elsewhere.
Generate QR Code:

After converting to a Data URL, hit Generate QR Code, and you’ll see your shiny new QR code pop up!
